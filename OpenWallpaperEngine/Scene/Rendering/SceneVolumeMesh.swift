/// The meshes WE draws a light's volume with (`wallpaper64.exe` 0x140196ce0, docs/lighting-plan.md
/// §2.8): built once per light, then placed each frame by `g_AltViewProjectionMatrix`.
///
/// - **Box** (a spot with a cookie or a shadow, 0x1401970a4): the 8 corners of the light's clip
///   volume, x and y ±1, z at the near and far depths, as 12 triangles. Placed by the inverse of
///   the light's projection, it is the light's frustum.
/// - **Cone** (any other spot, 0x140197258): 32 segments of the circle inscribed in that clip
///   square, at the near and far depths, with a fan cap at each; its centres are at (0.5, 0.5), as
///   WE writes them. Placed like the box, it is the spot's cone.
/// - **Sphere** (a point light, 0x14025c660 with radius 1): the poles and 23 rings of 25 vertices
///   (latitude steps of π/24, longitude steps of π/12). Placed by the light's radius and position.
///
/// WE's triangles are kept, but each is wound outward (counter-clockwise seen from outside), so the
/// renderer can pick the near or the far faces of the convex volume by culling
/// (`SceneVolumetricsPipelines`). The sphere's own index order wasn't traced [?]; it is a plain
/// band triangulation of WE's vertices.
