/// The render half of WE's audio spectrum: once per frame it turns the latest raw block (left 64,
/// right 64; `AudioSpectrumBlockTransform`) into the `g_AudioSpectrum*` / `registerAudioBuffers`
/// arrays. It follows `wallpaper64.exe`'s main loop (`0x140111654`–`0x140112b63`), which writes
/// the one buffer that both the shaders (`0x1400d9bc4`) and SceneScript (`0x14018e010`) read:
///
/// 1. rate = clamp(frame time, 0.0001, 0.25) (WE also multiplies by the wallpaper's playback rate,
///    1 here).
/// 2. Peaks: the raw values in 16 groups of 8 (left bands 0–7, 8–15, …, then right), each group's
///    maximum raised to at least a third of the overall maximum. Silent unless the overall maximum
///    is at least 0.0001.
/// 3. Per-group gain: a level that follows the group's peak, up by at most `rate` a frame and
///    down by at most `rate / 2`; set outright once within 0.0001; reset to 1 when sound starts
///    while the first level is at most 0.0001. Values are divided by max(level, 0.001), so they are
///    normally 0…1 but can exceed 1, as WE's docs warn.
/// 4. Smoothing: s += (value − s) · min(20·rate, 1), then the output moves toward s by at most
///    min(40·rate, 1) a frame. Silence outputs zeros at once and freezes both.
/// 5. average = (left + right) / 2; 32 and 16 bands are the maximum of neighbouring pairs of the
///    next finer resolution, for left, right and average alike.
///
/// WE divides with `rcpps` (relative error below 4·10⁻⁴); this divides exactly.
